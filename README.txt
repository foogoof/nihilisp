Nihilisp is an attempt to write a small Lisp which runs on the .Net
platform and eagerly uses the DLR.

The name is nihilism + lisp, since this is intended to be mostly
a learning experience more than a meaningful product. It should be
noted that max(my experience writing a lisp, my experience with the
clr) = 0.

See plans.org for a more detailed, technical list of goals.

Currently targets MonoDevelop.
